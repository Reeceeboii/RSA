# RSA
A basic implementation of the RSA Cryptosystem. Note that this is NOT cryptographically secure and is not destined to be used in any sort of practical or production sense. It is simply for demonstration and my own learning purposes.

For an in depth explanation of how RSA works, including the maths behind it, visit this repository's project page on my website @ https://reecemercer.dev/RSA
